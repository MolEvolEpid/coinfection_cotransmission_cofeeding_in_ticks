# coinfection_cotransmission_cofeeding_in_ticks
Code from Belluccini et al. "A story of viral co-infection, co-transmission and co-feeding in ticks: how to compute an invasion reproduction number"

The python file "R0_heatmaps.py" generates the heatmaps of the basic reproduction number R0 in Figure 2.
The python file "RI_heatmaps.py" generates the heatmaps of the invasion reproduction number RI in Figure 4. 
The mathematica notebook "Two_slots_neutrality.nb" contains the derivation of strain 1 endemic equilibrium (Appendix D.2), the computation of the invasion reproduction number (Appendix D.3) and the proof of its neutrality (Appendix D.4) for the two-slot model defined in Eq. (15). These results are also shown in the pdf file "Two_slots_neutrality.pdf".
